  ## Quick Description about the project 

  This is a program that will ask  a series of questions to automatically create a README file that you can use on all your projects.  This program uses node.js and a few different packages to make it run. After completeting all of the questions, you can preview the README file that was made, see if you like it and then save it to your computer so it's one less thing you have to worry about!

  ## Main problems faced when working on the project 
 
  Some big problems I first came across was how to use Node.js. Since this was a new topic for me, figuring out all the syntax and tricks was a bit difficult. I also had a hard time figuring out how to link the different licenses and badges for GitHub.  

  ## Main take aways from the project 

  Some main take aways I had from this project is how to read, write and create files using the FS feature. I also got a lot more comfortable using switch statements and how to call certain data points in differnt files. 

  ## Tests 

  ​There are no tests that need to be done when running this program.
